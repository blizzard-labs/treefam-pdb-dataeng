Dependencies: Biopython, Numpy, Pandas, Json, Matplotlib
Example Data in "data" folder - BRCA1 Sample Protein (arbitrarily chosen from treefam examples)

Constructs contact matrix, loads alignments - will be replaced by others' parts (currently proprietary and simple structured)

Final alignment_contacts numpy matrix: 
* Dimensions: Alignment Length x Alignement Length
* Axes: Residue I & Residue J
* Values: 0 no contact between residues in the alignment column; 1 contact between residues in alignment column
* Symmetric Matrix

Example Output (alignement_contacts):

[[0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0]]

* 1 at [0, 3] and [3, 0] means that residues 1 & 4 are in contact
* 0 at [0, 1] and [1, 0] means that residues 1 and 2 are not in contact


Functions:

create_pdb_to_alignment_mapping: Creates a dictionary of the mapping from the PDB position to the Alignment position
load_pdb_and_generate_contacts: Loads and creates contact matrix
map_contacts_to_alignment: Creates the previously described matrix
